Generate a script to create 2 tables in postegresql. The first table, called "tbl_cards", should save pokémon TCG (Trading Card Game) cards informations:
- HP
- NAME
- TYPE
- PREVIOUS STAGE
- INFO
- ATTACK
- DAMAGE
- WEAKNESS
- RESISTENCE
- RETREAT
- CARD NUMBER IN COLLECTION
The second table, called "tbl_collections", should be filled with more informations about the cards:
- ID
- COLLECTION SET NAME
- RELEASE DATE
- TOTAL CARDS IN COLLECTION

Note 1: Connect tables with a FOREIGN KEY
Note 2: Optimize the varchar fields to perfect size
Note 3: There´s no need to leave comments

Create another table and lint it to tbl_cards: create a table to separate type and a table to separate stage.
